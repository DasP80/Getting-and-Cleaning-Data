# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

•	Download the dataset

•	Load the activity,subject data and feature info

•	Loads features and labels for both the training and test datasets

•	Merges the training and test datasets

•	Extract the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

•	Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

•	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names

•	creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

•	The end result is saved in file named: second_tidy_data_set.csv and second_tidy_data_set.txt
